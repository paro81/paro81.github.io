    <p class="colordos">some hobbies i've developed over time were playing piano, photography, and drawing really badly (i used to make comics but i had some dry humor omg)
    <p class="colordos">i'm also tryna make some music but it's fr so confusing so i'm still tryna figure it all out</p>
    <p class="colordos">as for right now, i'm busy with studying, especially as time goes on. my aim is to have a steady job so i can pursue the little hobbies that i've still retained.</p>
    <p class="colordos">as much as i know how to program, i cannot place myself in front of pieces of text on a screen for more than an hour.</p>

    <p class="colordos">Newgrounds: /paro81 (ok i made this only to find banger gd music, nothing else, but if you message me on there, u get a free cookie!)
