    <summary class="coloruno">hobbies or passions?</summary>
    <p class="colordos">some hobbies i've developed over time were playing piano, photography, and drawing really badly (i used to make comics but i had some dry humor omg)
    <p class="colordos">as for right now, i'm busy with studying, especially as time goes on. my aim is to be at least a physician so i can pursue the little hobbies that i've still retained.</p>
    <p class="colordos">as much as i know how to program, i cannot place myself in front of pieces of text on a screen for more than an hour.</p>

    <p class="colordos">Discord: I do have a discord account, but I don't want to make it public yet :)</p>
    <p class="colordos">Soundcloud: /parzonote for more chillax, maybe ambient sounding instrumentals (plz don't listen to them they actually fr suck i just thought it'd be cool to post them somewhere)</p>
    <p class="colordos">/parzo1 as a main account for bigger projects (also idk why i made this considering that i don't post anything on my main accounts) </p>
    <p class="colordos">Newgrounds: /paro81 (ok i made this only to find banger gd music, nothing else i swear, but if you message me on there, u get a free cookie!)

<details>
    <summary class="coloruno"> why did you make this and why do you sometimes sound insane?</summary>
    <p class="colordos">this website may be slightly inspired by bill wurtz back when he was popular. i decided to write a JOURNAL about random things i thought and during may 2023 i found it and decided to make a website, having realized that's possible</p>
    <p class="colordos">now i sometimes post weird stuff (and secrets maybe?) on here just to pass the time and not be a lazy bum</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary class="coloruno"> you're weird. </summary>
