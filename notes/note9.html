i had to write some poetry today
<br>
and i'm writing these down here
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<u>limerick</u>
<br>
<em>english is confusing</em>
<br>
<em>sometimes, random but amusing</em>
<br>
<em>there are words</em>
<br>
<em>that can even mess up nerds</em>
<br>
<em>like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, antidisestablishmentarianism, and floccinaucinihilipilificating</em>
<br>
<br><br>
<u>haiku</u>
<br>
<em>life's a mystery</em>
<br>
<em>nobody knows its secret</em>
<br>
<em>though some might know a few</em>
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
honestly, i don't know how to write poetry. hopefully i don't get a f on the assignment
