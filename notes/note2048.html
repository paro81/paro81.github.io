<body>
sometimes the feeling of not being able to understand anything happens to me a little too often. maybe it's delusion, but one may wonder.
<br>
it's a constant stimuli of information, and that's what i'm slightly concerned about
<br>
not a fear, yet it's more like fomo.
<br>
good to let things out and live simple; darum geht es im leben
