<li> starting to add more decoration with recently how to properly use css</li>
<li> this doesn't look really decorative though</li>
<li> but it's interesting to see what i can do with more messy stuff like this</li>
<li> might make the website more minimalistic in coming days (probably not)</li>
<li> don't wanna make another entry for this but may 7th, i just found out how to use different languages and implement them in html an it worked like crazy ok ik its just javascript but like this is gonna make life so much more easier in terms of organization, which i will probably not improve in anytime soon </li>
<p class="ul"> February 4, 2024 </p>
