2023 was a decent year. out of the pandemic and now life's back to normal... right?
<br>
i've been digging in the deep parts of the internet (what everyone does when they're bored i think) and i found old blog posts from the 90s
<br>
and i saw how similar the style is to mine, albeit i'm a little lazy when it comes to formatting
<br>
then u really get this sense of FOMO since all of this was before big organizations encompassed what we go on today
<br>
and anyone can make their own platform, garnering a niche community but also have a massive following too
<br>
all it is now is... well if you know, you know.
<br>
huh, now it's christmas. and it'll be 2024 soon. honestly i felt like 2014 was only a year, two years ago, but a decade?
<br>
and then 2004 will be 20 years ago. and 1994 will be-- nevermind, you get what i'm saying. (apparently yahoo will be 30 years old, but who uses that anymore?)
<br>
i'm pretty sure in 20 to 30 years in the future, people'll be saying the same thing that i've been thinking about
<br>
so next year, i'll experiement with different forms of content as per time and motivation allots. i won't garuntee it'll bring sucsess, but hopefully i'll feel a sense of accomplishment in doing so
<br>
as for this 'site, i wanna try getting my own domain (but some of the prices can be crazy) and we'll see how much i can program before i burn out
<br>
<br>
midnight thoughts, am i rite? (i promise i won't do write long pieces of text for a while)
<br>
<br>
anyway, have a good christmas and a great new year :)
<br>
<br>
also, i've been thinking of a name change. does "parzo" sound good? i think it does, better than whatever "paro81" means. but i claim both of them. (also "parzonote" is mine)
