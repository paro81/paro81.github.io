  <h1>Space Radiation Shielding</h1>
  <p>
    Investigating how material chemistry, biology, and physics reduce cellular damage from radiation during long-duration space missions.
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Theme:</strong> Radiation shielding materials for human space exploration.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Research Question:</strong> How does increased radiation exposure affect cellular damage in humans during long-duration space missions, and how can material choice mitigate this risk?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Relevance:</strong> Astronauts traveling beyond Earth’s magnetosphere (e.g., Moon, Mars missions) are exposed to Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events. Effective shielding is essential to reduce cancer risk, DNA damage, and long-term health impacts.

  <h2>Biology: Radiation & Human Health</h2>
  <p>
    This biology section focuses on how space radiation affects human cells and health, directly addressing the research question by linking radiation exposure to biological damage and long-term risk.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of Space Radiation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs):</strong> Extremely high-energy protons and heavy ions (e.g. iron nuclei) originating outside the solar system. Highly penetrating and difficult to shield.</li>
    <li><strong>Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs):</strong> High-energy protons released during solar flares and coronal mass ejections, capable of delivering acute radiation doses.</li>
    <li><strong>Trapped Radiation:</strong> Protons and electrons confined within Earth’s Van Allen belts, affecting astronauts in low-Earth orbit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cellular & DNA Damage Mechanisms</h3>
  <p>
    Space radiation is ionising, meaning it has sufficient energy to remove electrons from atoms within biological tissue. This leads to direct DNA strand breaks and indirect damage via free radicals produced when radiation interacts with water molecules inside cells.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Single-strand DNA breaks are often repairable.</li>
    <li>Double-strand breaks are harder to repair and may cause permanent mutations.</li>
    <li>Incorrect repair can lead to uncontrolled cell division and cancer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Health Risks & Dose Exposure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Radiation exposure is measured in sieverts (Sv), accounting for biological impact.</li>
    <li>Earth background radiation: ~2–3 mSv/year.</li>
    <li>ISS exposure: ~100–150 mSv/year.</li>
    <li>Deep-space missions may result in several hundred mSv over months.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Risk increases cumulatively with dose and mission duration. No level of ionising radiation is considered completely safe.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Long-Duration Missions Increase Risk</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond low-Earth orbit, Earth’s magnetic protection weakens significantly. This results in higher daily radiation doses, accumulation of cellular damage over time, and increased lifetime cancer risk for astronauts.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Environmental Systems & Societies Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to chemical and biological effectiveness, radiation shielding materials were evaluated using an Environmental Systems & Societies (ESS) perspective. This analysis considers the environmental costs of material production, sustainability during long-duration missions, and the potential to reduce emissions through optimized material selection.
  </p>

  <h3>Environmental Costs of Material Production</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aluminium:</strong> Highly energy-intensive extraction via electrolysis (Hall–Héroult process), producing significant CO₂ emissions and red mud waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrogen-rich polymers (e.g., polyethylene):</strong> Derived from petrochemical feedstocks; lower energy requirement per kilogram than aluminium but associated with fossil fuel use.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced composites and nanomaterials:</strong> Often have higher initial production energy costs due to complex synthesis, though mass efficiency may offset this.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sustainability of Long-Duration Space Missions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reducing spacecraft mass lowers launch fuel requirements and environmental impact.</li>
    <li>Multi-functional materials (e.g., water used for both life support and shielding) improve resource efficiency.</li>
    <li>Durable, low-maintenance materials reduce the need for resupply missions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Linking Material Choice to Reduced Emissions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hydrogen-rich materials provide greater radiation protection per unit mass, allowing thinner shielding layers.</li>
    <li>Lower mass directly correlates with reduced rocket fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions during launch.</li>
    <li>Layered shielding strategies minimize total material use while maximizing protection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    From an ESS perspective, hydrogen-rich and multi-purpose materials offer a more sustainable solution for future space exploration by balancing human health protection with reduced environmental impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    This investigation follows a <strong>secondary research–based methodology</strong>, supported by quantitative simulation data and experimental results published in peer‑reviewed scientific literature. A practical laboratory experiment was not feasible due to the hazardous nature of ionizing radiation and the specialist facilities required. Instead, validated computational models and empirical studies were used.
  </p>

  <h3>Research Design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A comparative materials analysis was conducted focusing on aluminium, hydrogen‑rich polymers, water, and advanced composites.</li>
    <li>Data were sourced from NASA, ESA, ScienceDirect, PubMed, MDPI, and materials science journals.</li>
    <li>Only studies using recognised radiation transport models (e.g., HZETRN, OLTARIS, GEANT4) were selected to ensure reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Variables Considered</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Independent variables:</strong> Material type, atomic composition, hydrogen content, density.</li>
    <li><strong>Dependent variables:</strong> Absorbed dose (Gy), dose equivalent (Sv), secondary particle production.</li>
    <li><strong>Controlled variables:</strong> Radiation type (GCR, SPE), shield mass, and simulated exposure duration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Planning Process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Define the research question linking radiation exposure to cellular damage.</li>
    <li>Identify materials commonly proposed for spacecraft shielding.</li>
    <li>Extract quantitative dose‑reduction data per unit mass.</li>
    <li>Relate physical shielding performance to biological impact using dose equivalent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Processing & Reliability</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Results from multiple sources were cross‑compared to identify consistent trends.</li>
    <li>Outliers or non‑space‑relevant studies were excluded.</li>
    <li>Peer‑review status and institutional credibility were used as reliability criteria.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This methodology ensures that conclusions are evidence‑based, reproducible, and directly applicable to real‑world space mission scenarios. Realistically, the data will be collected from NASA reports and other papers that give clear data to compare with.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Results / Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Results from biological, chemical, and materials science studies were synthesised to evaluate how radiation exposure translates into health risk, and how material choice alters this outcome. The findings consistently show that both <strong>dose magnitude</strong> and <strong>mission duration</strong> are critical determinants of biological harm.
  </p>

  <h3>Biological Risk Trends</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Astronauts on the ISS receive approximately 100–150 mSv per year, significantly higher than Earth’s natural background (~2–3 mSv/year).</li>
    <li>Projected deep-space missions (e.g. Mars) may expose astronauts to 600–1000 mSv cumulatively.</li>
    <li>Higher cumulative dose correlates with increased DNA double-strand breaks and long-term cancer risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Effect of Shielding on Dose Reduction</h3>
  <p>
    Comparative analysis shows that hydrogen-rich materials consistently reduce dose equivalent more effectively per unit mass than aluminium or high-Z metals. This directly lowers the probability of cellular mutation and tissue damage.

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Graph Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        The graph shows that cumulative radiation dose increases with mission duration for all shielding materials; however, the rate of increase differs significantly depending on material composition. Aluminium shielding exhibits the steepest dose increase, indicating lower attenuation efficiency against high-energy particles. In contrast, polyethylene shows the slowest increase, demonstrating superior dose reduction per unit mass due to its high hydrogen content. Water provides intermediate protection, outperforming aluminium but remaining less effective than polyethylene. This trend supports the conclusion that hydrogen-rich materials reduce biological radiation exposure more effectively during long-duration space missions.

  <h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why is space radiation more dangerous than radiation on Earth?</h3>
      <p>Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field absorb most harmful particles. In space, astronauts are exposed directly to high-energy ionising radiation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why not use lead for shielding?</h3>
      <p>Although lead blocks radiation effectively, its high density makes it inefficient for spaceflight and increases secondary particle production.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why are hydrogen-rich materials preferred?</h3>
      <p>Hydrogen atoms efficiently slow protons and neutrons while producing fewer secondary particles, reducing biological damage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Can astronauts be fully protected from radiation?</h3>
      <p>No. Current technology can reduce but not eliminate exposure, making mission duration and shielding design critical.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Does radiation damage spacesuits?</h3>
      <p>Radiation can degrade polymers over time, limiting suit lifespan, but suits are not designed to provide full radiation shielding.</p>
