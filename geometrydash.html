    <li>Made an account in November 2022, so data will be more accurate but also had to reset some stats, losing a few hundred stars.
    <li>1k ~ February 10, 2022</li>
    <li>(I would get GD on steam on april 6, 2023 fyi)</li>
    <li>Downloaded Full Version on Mobile - August 1, 2021</li>
    <li>Got GD World when it was first released, but I would probably only get two or three hundred stars max before I'd delete the app on an unregistered account.
    <li>Slight chance I may have downloaded Lite version in 2014 due to popularity.
